This is a simple arithmetic calculator implemented in C. It evaluates arithmetic expressions containing non-negative integers and the operators +, -, *, /, and parentheses ( and ). The program reads an expression from standard input, parses it, and prints the result.
## Features

- **Supported Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `(`, `)`.
- **Whitespace Handling**: Any whitespace characters are allowed in the input.
- **Input Size**: The input is assumed to be shorter than 1 KiB.
- **Output**: The program outputs only the result of the evaluated expression (an integer).
- **No External Dependencies**: The program uses only the standard C library (`libc`).

## Compilation
The program is contained entirely in main.c.
To compile the program, run the following command:

```bash
gcc main.c -o calc.exe
```
